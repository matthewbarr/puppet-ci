puppet-ci
=========

Puppet CI module

It depends on the puppet-jenkins module from https://github.com/jenkinsci/puppet-jenkins.  

(it's also in the forge, rtyler/jenkins.  The readme on the forge is out of date :( )

For now, it needs manual editing, you can do this via the Jenkins GUI.  You'll need to set the Repo's on the Main settings,
and the URL for the github project in the job configuration.
